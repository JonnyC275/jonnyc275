# Background

Once we had the [distributors](https://www.tractiontests.com/tests/biz-dev-cpg-brand) signed on, it was time to do some ridealongs with the sales reps working for them. A ridealong is when you go visit stores with a rep in order to present your product to managers and try to get them to stock it.

The goal is to get the product listed in the right stores that will sell through with it and then re-order. One-off orders aren't worthwhile in wholesale due to the lower overall margin per unit, so it's critical to spend your time on the right stores.

# Approach

To line up ridealongs, I called or emailed different reps in territories that I hadn't been before and asked when they were available.

Typically, reps and stores offer a limited-time promotion on site called an ISO, for Initial Stocking Offer. For example: buy two cases, get 20% off.

The reps would pick me up at my AirBnB and then we'd go visit their stores for the day. Each day, we managed to visit about 6 stores. 

When speaking with the managers, I'd start out by asking about their current lineup of products in our category to get an idea of their knowledge starting out. This would help me tailor my approach and which benefits I highlight in my pitch.

Then I'd go through the product and its benefits over competitors, explain the type of customer it appeals to, and frequently I'd disqualify us to make it a softer sell by saying something like:

>It's not right for every store, because it really depends on your customer base. If your customers really care about natural ingredients, transparent sourcing, and the quality of their products, then it could be a great fit for them.

After the pitch, I'd line up the close by asking:

>Do you think our brand would be a good fit for your customers?

When they said yes, I'd ask them:

>Great, why don't you give us a shot in your store? We have a 100% guarantee so there's no risk, and we have a 20% discount today for new stores listing us.

By working with the reps and taking a laid-back approach, we managed to achieve a closing rate of 82%, so 4 out of every 5 stores became a new customer.

# Lessons Learned

## Leverage Partners
It was only by working with the sales reps and asking for their help with placement in their territory did we manage to get into good stores. Their relationship and credibility with the customers are what drove our high listing rate.

## Focus on Fit
Target your best customers, not everyone. You don't want to sell to a customer who you're confident won't be successful with your product. That's bad ethics and they'll tell their friends.

## Bigger Average Order Value = Shorter Payback Period
One of the biggest limiting factors is how quickly your customer acquisition strategy can generate a net return. It doesn't mean much if you're acquiring a lot of customers but it takes 3 years for them to be profitable. 

In our case, because our brand only had one product at the time, our payback period was 11 months. The average initial order a store could place for our brand was about $100. To really make this channel work and pay off quickly, we'd need it up over $300 at a minimum.
