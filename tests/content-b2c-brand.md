# Background

After launching my business in 2015, I started looking for low-cost marketing channels to grow. We didn't have a big budget for testing out PPC and I'd read that it generally only worked for eCommerce products with Average Order Values over $50, which wasn't the case with ours at $30. 

I'd heard that content/SEO was a long-term strategy that could generate results over many years, so I decided to get the first content out there myself and then I would hire a content writer afterwards to work on the brand.

# Approach

The first article I wrote was a catch-all guide to our product category, which none of our competitors had taken the time to write. Using Google Autocomplete, I filled in things like: 

* *is "product category" good*
* *is "product" safe*
* *how is "product"*
* *"product" vs*

I assumed that whatever came up as the highest rated suggestions for searches were the most frequently searched questions relating to the product.

After writing the first article and publishing it, I hired a content writer who was interested in the pet industry. She was a hard worker and took the time to research the articles very thoroughly. Each post was about 1500 words and included detailed citations to various research papers.

Our writer regularly suggested article ideas based on what she was seeing as trends in the industry. As well, to help come up with content ideas, I used Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and AnswerThePublic.com to see what questions people had about our category of products.

# Core Article Structure

* Why It's Really Important
  * Benefit 1
  * Benefit 2
  * Benefit 3

*A summary of the various benefits of the product*

* This Type is Best, not That Other One
  * That Other One is Ineffective

*Evidence-based explanation of why a certain type of raw material was better than another*

* "Our Product Type" vs "Other Type #1" vs "Other Type #2"
  * Factor #1
  * Factor #2
  * Factor #3

*Detailed explanations of the different factors that affect the quality of different raw materials that are used. Detailed descriptions like this are valuable because while most people won't read them, those that do are the most interested and also the most likely to become advocates for your company once they're convinced you have the best product.*

* Common Misconception Debunked
  * How It Works
  * X vs Y
  * A vs B
  * Your options

*A research-based dispelling of a popular myth in the community, with relevant details and recommendations*

* Unknown Important Factor  & Main Recommendation
** Why Bother
** Truth vs Marketing
** Summary

*A critical detail that most people don't know about but which could help them out big time, plus a couple points explaining why it's so important and what they can do. I also included a section to attack the labeling practices of some other companies, which I found in my research to be inaccurate and misleading.*

* Conclusion
** Call to Action

*Simple paragraph inviting readers to contact us, plus one link to our main product at the end of the page.*

# Lessons Learned

This channel was very profitable for the company. The initial article that I wrote generated over $1,000 in revenue per month on average, let alone the intangible benefits of introducing tens of thousands more people to our brand.

As a channel overall, SEO-friendly content grew our traffic by around 115% per year, compounded annually.

In three years, organic search traffic went from 1,000 visitors to 10,000 per month.

The economics were great as well, as seen in the metrics up top.

## Usefulness Before Everything

The one piece of content that got the most traffic and sales on our blog was the one that I wrote and that covered the entire category. I'm pretty sure it got results because it was a really useful article that highlighted the important thoughts that went into making our product. The segment was so obscure that a lot of people weren't aware of the benefits and pitfalls of choosing one product over the other.

## Keywords are Critical

Use the tools available to find what people are searching for and create content that answers their questions. Don't be afraid to go for obscure topics as it could mean there is less competition for that keyword, and the results with that article over time could be worth the investment in time or money.
