title: How I Got a Software Sales Job with No Degree and Little Pertinent Experience
description: Sales
---

# Summary

18 months after founding, my company was having a cash flow problems as I had bought way too much inventory in preparation for our appearance on Dragon's Den. I spoke with my investors and let them know I was going to stop taking a salary to keep the company healthy.

I started looking for a sales job in late 2016. With no degree and only junior sales experience on my CV before starting my own business, I thought I would do better if I contacted companies directly without going through a competitive hiring process.

I decided to treat my job hunt like a sales process.

# Approach

I used the Profit 500, Inc 5000, and Angel List to build a lead list of the most interesting, growing software companies I could find. 

I would use the lists to first find the software companies, then I would research each company to decide if I'd want to work there.

Questions I was trying to answer:

1. Is the space, product, problem interesting to me? (*Look up their website, read through their material and see if I "get it"*)
	
2. Is the company financially healthy, are people happy working there? (*Glassdoor, AngelList*)
	
3. Is the pay competitive? (*Glassdoor*)

Then I paid a guy on Upwork $30 to research their VP Sales, CMO, whoever was in charge of sales, so I could reach out to them.

He also provided me with their LinkedIn link so right before sending the emails, I could open their profile (they see I viewed them and can check out my profile) and customize the email for them.

Then I imported the lead list into Close.io and started sending cold emails (tracking open, click, and reply rates).

# Qualified Opportunities

## Company #1
Healthcare SaaS company that didn't have any listed jobs, but the VP said he had the budget to hire another rep and was interested in talking. They flew me down to Chicago for a round of interviews, I got green lights all around, but then their budget got slashed a few weeks after our meeting. We stayed in touch afterwards but I was happy at the role I ended up at.

## Company #2
Financial SaaS company with a couple listed jobs and an interesting product. The VP liked my entrepreneurial background but after some back-and-forth and an interview, decided that they only wanted to hire US-based reps.

## Company #3
HR software company, their VP referred me down to the lead for their SDR and AE teams in my region. They were working on next year's budget, uncertain of how many spots they'd have. It went back and forth a couple of times but finally I got the offer from the other companies and stopped following up.

## Company #4 (Job Application) — Offer received
I saw a listing that was in a town about 3 hours away and it seemed interesting so I applied, got a call back and interview. Starting role was as a junior sales rep but I negotiated it to a level higher. Finally passed on this one as the on-target earning were lower than the 2nd offer, plus I had to move for the job.

## Company #5 — Offer received
Insurance and financial SaaS company, remote role, recently funded. I got along with the head of sales very quickly and he introduced me to the CEO for an interview. Then I did a mock pitch for the head of sales, the marketing lead, and top sales guy. After the various hoops, I got an offer, sent a counter-offer, and got the green light.

# Final Metrics
*  123 companies contacted
* 3 opportunities created / 19%
* 5 qualified opportunities / 4% — includes the job application, so technically would be 3 from the cold approach
* 2 offers received / 1.6%
* 58 days from start to finish
* 530 total emails sent (everything incl follow ups, bounced, etc)
* 322 emails received
* 70+ calls (didn't track all of them)

# Lessons Learned

* Hustle pays off
* Job applications get better response rates but lower pay positions
* Bigger companies = more junior positions
* Smaller companies considered me for more senior roles way more than larger companies
* Find a manager willing to take a risk on you and you can short circuit the career path if you have some semi-related experience. Obviously you should have some sales experience to get into a closing role, it's fairly unlikely to leap into an enterprise AE role right off the bat.
