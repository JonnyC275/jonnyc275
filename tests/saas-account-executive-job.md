# Summary

18 months after founding, my company was having a cash flow problems as I had bought way too much inventory in preparation for our appearance on Dragon's Den. I spoke with my investors and let them know I was going to stop taking a salary to keep the company healthy.

I started looking for a sales job in early 2018. With no degree and only junior sales experience on my CV before starting my own business, I thought I would do better if I contacted companies directly without going through a competitive hiring process.

I decided to treat my job hunt like a sales process.

# Approach

I used the Profit 500, Inc 5000, and Angel List to build a lead list of the most interesting, growing software companies I could find. 

I would use the lists to first find the software companies, then I would research each company to decide if I'd want to work there.

Questions I was trying to answer:
	1. Is the space, product, problem interesting to me? (*Look up their website, read through their material and see if I "get it"*)
	2. Is the company financially healthy, are people happy working there? (*Glassdoor, AngelList*)
	3. Is the pay competitive? (*Glassdoor*)

Then I paid a guy on Upwork $30 to research their VP Sales, CMO, whoever was in charge of sales, so I could reach out to them.

He also provided me with their LinkedIn link as well so right before sending the emails, I can open their profile (they see I viewed them and can check out my profile) and I can customize the email for them if there's something to comment on.

Then I imported the lead list into Close.io and started sending cold emails (tracking open, click, and reply rates).
