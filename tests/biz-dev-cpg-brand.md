title: Securing Two Distributors for CPG Brand
description: Business Development
---
# Background
I launched my brand with one product in June 2015, through Amazon and our own website. We had some good results and early traction, managed to get up to $8-12k/month fairly quickly. By late 2015, I started thinking seriously about how to get to the next level.

I figured there were two potential paths:
1. launching a 2nd product and selling it via Amazon and our website,
2. or investing the money, time and energy into a retail launch through stores and distributors.

# Approach

I chose to master selling this one product on multiple channels. Developing alternate sales channels is a great way to grow a business as you lessen your reliance on one sales channel and you learn how the whole supply chain in your industry works.

The trade-off is that it's more time and cash intensive, as there are known and unknown startup costs to each new channel you commit to.

To kick things off, I started building a lead list of companies to call on via Google and LinkedIn. I loaded the companies I found into Pipedrive. I managed to find 18 companies in Canada that distributed in their own regions. A couple were national distributors but most had defined provincial territories they served.

I started calling them to see about getting a product listed with them. My script was pretty straightforward, I just asked to speak to the buyer and asked them their process for evaluating taking on new products.

One of the first guys I spoke with was super helpful but caught me off-guard…

>Oh hey, are you going to be coming to the trade show coming up?

*Which one was that again?*

>PIJAC this weekend!

*Of course I'll be there! I'll swing by your booth to say hi*

I hung up the phone and told my fiancée we were going to this show, that I hadn't even known existed a few minutes before.

I didn’t even have business cards yet! I had no sell sheet and just a sample with no retail packaging.

I figured the least I could do is get some cards. I ordered some from Moo and paid for the overnight/express shipping option and got it 48 hours later, the afternoon before we were leaving for the show.

# First Trade Show

So now I have the un-packaged sample, about 50 business cards (didn’t want to spend too much on them), my fiancée and 4-month old son with me.

We arrive at the show with a stroller, and I’m wearing a suit since the industry I was in before was way more formal.

Not this one.

I was the *only* person in the entire building that had a suit on! I sneakily shed my suit jacket and rolled up my shirt sleeves.

I found the buyer in their booth and stalked him from behind a rack of dog treats, waiting for his customers to leave. Finally, they cleared away and I moved in for the kill.

We talked for about five minutes and he was really interested, said the benefits of the product sounded clear and he’d definitely consider it. Told me to follow up with sample and sell sheet, then call him for next steps.

I left the booth, did a little happy dance and then repeated the process with another 5 distributors at the show. I figured if one hot lead was good, five was better, right?!

After the show, I followed up with each distributor, with a sample and typed + signed letter. The letter used humor to talk about the product and how it’d be a fit for their customers, and help them make money *hat tip to Cashvertising.*

# Second Trade Show

About a month after that first show, there was another one in Ontario. This time I came more prepared.

I had a professional looking sell sheet printed on thick stock paper, more business cards, no suit, and a ghetto looking prototype of the retail packaging.

The prototype was literally a plain white box in the shape of the final packaging, with a distorted image on home printer paper, *held together with scotch tape.*

Surprisingly, the reception was really positive. None of the competing products have nice packaging, so buyers thought that it would definitely stand out on the shelf.

The same initial buyer from the first show was the most interested, snapping pictures on his cellphone and telling me he’d really like to discuss this more in-depth after the show.

Again, I repeated the process with a bunch of other distributors.

Elated and on top of the world after the show, I started following up with all the interested buyers. Thinking we’d have a deal cinched up in no time! It would have been about 45 days from start to closing the first deal.

But it wouldn't be that simple...

# Follow up, follow up, and more follow up

>“Oh we’re preparing for Q4, just focusing on re-stocking current SKUs.”

>“Sorry, she’s not in… can I take a message?”

>“He’s not here but how about I take your number and get back to you?”

>“You’re more expensive than Bargain Bin Junk Brand, we’re not interested.”

>“You’re competing with one of our better brands, we can’t take you on.”

I’d call, follow up with email, leave voicemails, ask for different employees to speak with, and repeat the process with each distributor.

I literally kept calling until they said no. I let a couple of the super uninterested ones fall by the wayside… But any of the distributors that were even semi-interested got regular phone calls and emails from me, updating them with the product packaging and any other new developments.

Finally, after **THREE MONTHS** of constant calls and emails, having met them at two trade shows and sent them a sample and signed letter… I had the original interested distributor invite me for a meeting at their offices in Ontario!
I immediately said yes and booked the trip.

Then I booked a meeting with their biggest competitor just down the road from them, two hours after our scheduled meeting… just in case.

# The Meeting

The meeting took place three weeks later, with the CEO, plus the two guys in charge of Sales and Purchasing.

The buyer took me for a tour of their huge warehouse, showing me the hundreds of pallets they were moving each day. A good sign of things to come, it felt like they were selling me on their company as much as I was trying to sell them on my product. It felt like a true partnership to be.

We sat down, went over the product, my background, and the plan for launching the product in the Canadian retail market. At the end of our meeting, they said they'd talk it over together and get back to me quickly.

A few days later, they confirmed they were going to take us on. 

**It took 134 days from start to finish. 4 months and 12 days.**

They distribute to half of Canada, to thousands of accounts in a variety of locations and niches.

This partnership was a great move for us and them, they ended up selling tens of thousands of units of our products, getting us into more than 300+ of their accounts. 

# 2nd Distributor

Meanwhile, throughout this entire process, one of the other distributors in the other half of Canada that I’d been working was leading me on, didn’t seem to be going anywhere...

She finally confirmed they would take on our brand, 20 minutes before my fiancée and I went on Dragon’s Den.

What it took to close that deal? WHILE I was running the rest of the business and trying to close these other distributors?

* 29 phone calls (8 voice mails, 14 no answer)
* 10 emails (only one was answered, the "yes" email from her)
* 1 sample + signed letter

**234 days from start to finish. 7 months and 21 days.**

It was really tough to close it, but now we’ll be available across the country and have access to their hundreds of accounts.

# Lessons Learned

## Invest in Making a Great Product

You need to spend the time and money on making a product that provides more value to your customers in many ways. Beating them in one axis isn't enough, you have to crush them in several different ways. Relabeling it isn't enough, the distributors and store owners have seen it all

Beat them on design and branding, packaging, quality of materials, marketing efforts, sourcing practices, distribution channels, size, price, the more the better. It's rare that you'll hit on each point, but beat them on as many as you can.
Investing in a better product up front makes selling it that much easier later on.

## Thinking Bigger

When you think bigger, you eliminate a lot of your competition that’s fighting each other in the trenches for the "low-hanging fruit."

After all this work, we suddenly had a number of sales channels to insert new products into: online in the US + Canada, plus two Canadian distributors. 

Even better, the retail side of our business is what got us noticed by the company that would eventually acquire us. They kept seeing us everywhere and their CEO had to get us on board.

## It Takes More Time and Money than You Think

It took about three times longer than I thought to close one deal. I also spent a lot of money on packaging, travel, samples and shipping, etc. That was a risk. I also spent a lot of time on it that detracted from product development, digital marketing, etc. 

## Be Relentless

Literally you need to just keep going and trying to find ways to contact the buyers. Don’t stop. Don’t give up. If they give you a genuine “no,” then ditch them for now and move on. Call them back in a few months if you think they're actually a good fit but the timing is wrong.

If one prospect is giving you interest, GREAT! Ask for the sale. Get the order. If they don’t buy, then call their competitor right afterwards, and make a note in your CRM to follow up with them in a few weeks or months.

## Get Used to Discomfort

There was a lot of times where my palms were sweating like crazy, heart beating irregularly, stress hormones through the roof. This was NOT comfortable, and it was NOT a walk in the park. 

I had to take short breaks a couple of times and give myself a few days off from calling and emailing. I even thought about quitting once or twice during this process, mainly when we were out of stock due to a production mistake and people weren't returning my calls.

I learned a lot about myself and I'm proud I pushed through to get the deals.
