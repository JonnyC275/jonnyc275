# Background

Right after the [retail launch](https://www.tractiontests.com/tests/biz-dev-cpg-brand) for my brand, I wanted to get some more local visibility and thought a trade show would be a good idea. There was one coming up very soon so we booked a last-minute booth and negotiated a discount to the usual rate because we were a new company.

The show was expected to attract around 12,000 visitors, so my hypothesis was that if we had a 1% conversion rate, we'd make 120 sales and cover the cost of the show plus some profit and gain some awareness in the region.

# Approach

Our booth was right in front of the main entrance, so we had a decent amount of foot traffic. However, we found it difficult to get people to stop and chat with us. Tried out several different approaches, ranging from "Hey, how are you?" to "Are you currently using any XYZ products?"

Even when we did get people to stop and talk to us, frequently they weren't the right type of customer.  Our products were natural health supplements for dogs and cats, and the people in this region generally didn't seem that aware of the benefits of supplements in general.

>“I don't even take supplements for myself, why would I give them to my dog?”

>“What's an omega-3?”

Thankfully, we did meet some good potential customers who were interested and did buy some products on the spot.

The only problem… the conversion rate was more like **0.1% instead of 1%.** I was off by an order of magnitude!

# Lessons Learned

Overall this show was a flop, thankfully we did learn some lessons.

## Know Your Audience

I jumped into this trade show too quickly. If I had done a bit of research on the region, I would have seen that it's much lower-income than I thought. As a premium brand in the category, we can't compete on price so it's important to find the right buyers. I should have waited for a bigger show in a higher-income city to get the most bang for my buck.

## Understand the Buyer's Journey

The nature of our product is that it required education from someone they trust. Typically, this was handled at the retailer level where an employee would take the time to explain the benefits of using products in our category. Achieving that level of education with a stranger at a trade show was difficult.

## ATTENTION!

Your materials, first words, and body language should all be conducive to getting someone's attention while they're walking by and convincing them to stop and talk to you.

## Wear Comfy Shoes

With padded soles, oof.
