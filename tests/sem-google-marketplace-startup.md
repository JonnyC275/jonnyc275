# Background

A marketplace startup that already had good supply was facing challenges with the consumer demand on its platform. It had a ratio of 1-1 suppliers / consumers, while similar successful companies had 1 supplier for every 10 clients, indicating there was an imbalance. 

As part of a broader user acquisition strategy including SEO, Engineering, Partnerships and other PPC channels, I tested out Google Ads to determine its long-term viability. The ultimate goal of this campaign was to convert more consumers to balance out the supply on the platform.

They had previously been using radio advertising, generating a cost per acquisition of around $22 per user, and a cost per listing of $89.

# Approach

I did keyword research using SimilarWeb, Google Autocomplete, and the Google Keyword Planner to target the top 25 keywords for the two most popular categories on the platform.

I also had conversion triggers installed for the steps of the customer journey: sign-up, first log-in, creating a listing, and completing a transaction.

The campaign structure was:

* Campaign
  * Ad group #1 (Main Service)
    * Ad A
    * Ad B
    * Ad C
  * Ad group #2 (Main Service)
    * Ad A
    * Ad B
    * Ad C

2 weeks after starting the campaign, I made adjustments and paused some keywords that weren't generating any conversions despite a decent click through rate.

The ads included sitelink extensions to take up more space in the search results, as well as a phone number to speak with a rep at the company. We also made three versions for each ad group.

# Lessons Learned

Overall this channel showed good potential, although due to the lower customer lifetime value, the payback period was a bit long at 12 months. With some tweaks it could be improved to maybe 6 months, which would still require a significant amount of capital to fund the growth.

Simple math: if your CPA is $12.60 and you want to acquire 10,000 users, you need $126,000 to float you for 6 months, not counting other fixed costs like salaries and rent.

My recommendations for this channel were to continue to optimize the keywords and bids to lower user CPA, while focusing on improving conversion rates further down the funnel with some simple UI tweaks in the platform.

## Always Be Testing

We had a few surprises with this campaign, certain ad copy that had much weaker volume than expected, while there were a couple that outperformed the others. **The worst ad had a conversion rate of 6%, while the best one had a conversion rate of 32%!**

## Consider Scale

While Google Ads performed well, there wasn't enough scale available to it. There's only so many people searching for our particular set of keywords per month, so we found that it was capped to a point. The niche has maybe 10-15k searches per month, so even if we monopolize the ad space and get a great 10% CTR, it's only 1500 clicks per month which would turn into 300-400 users.
