# Background

I initially launched my brand on Amazon, as there was an existing infrastructure of buyers and fulfillment capabilities. The fees, while high, were much less than the same cost to set up my own warehouse and hire employees to manage. Even better, most of the costs were variable and only applied as we sold units, so aside from the monthly subscription there was little to no risk to this sales channel.

# Approach

Before launching, I built the product listing out using the best practices of copywriting and eCommerce that I'd been able to find. Focusing on benefits, not features, appealing to emotions, etc. I also had some nice explanatory/lifestyle images created that offered a bit more information than standard product images.

In 2015, it was still the Wild West on Amazon. There were ways to launch new products and get reviews very quickly by blasting out steep discounts to groups of thousands of consumers. This helped your product get rankings for certain keywords right off the bat, indicating to Amazon's A9 search algorithm that your product was very relevant to consumers searching in your category. 

Then I paid a company that had built a list of buyers to send out our offer and get some reviews. The total cost was around $500 and we had 150 sales within a day on the product, which became 120 reviews over the course of a few weeks. This jumpstarted our sales and got us a lot of visibility on the platform, getting us on the front page of search results for our main keyword.

I then set up an email autoresponder using Feedback Genius to request reviews from customers. Overall I found that about 1% of customers left reviews.

Once we were up and running, I started PPC campaigns on Amazon to drive more traffic for certain keywords. Getting conversions on those keywords showed Amazon's algorithm that your product was relevant for that search, and helped your organic search ranking at the same time.

# Lessons Learned

Amazon was a great sales channel overall, but with some caveats. I still think that product companies should generally sell on Amazon, unless they have some defensible product differentiation. It's known that the company will use sales data for popular products to rip them off and compete directly with its sellers.

With that being said, it still remains that platform with almost 50% of eCommerce market share, so it's still in brands' best interests to list their products on it and actively market through the site.

## Competition

There are so many new brands starting up regularly, [some of them owned by Amazon](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-private-labels-some-grow-quickly-data-shows-2019-4), that your ranking can quickly tank if you're not reviewing your keywords or split testing new approaches

## Launch Costs

To effectively launch a product on Amazon, you need to be willing to a) invest lots of money in their advertising programs and b) run your price really low for a while to build up sales volume. This means holding inventory and breaking even on it for a while, which is not easy to do as a start-up just from a cash flow perspective.

## Lack of Control

At any time, your account can be frozen if a handful of customers (or unscrupulous competitors) file complaints against you. They also control the advertising results, while selling competing products from their private label brands against you. The incentives are a bit wonky, to say the least: *sell your product on my site, against my own brands, and you have to pay me for ads to get eyeballs on your listing.*

## Profitable

Even with all the negative points, Amazon was a great channel and generated a payback on customers within 2 months, so it fueled our growth in a big way.
